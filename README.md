# Overview of the Project
In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent that uses reinforcement learning techniques to navigate an environment and achieve a goal efficiently. The aim was to apply neural networks and reinforcement learning concepts to a simulated, real-world-inspired problem, allowing the agent to learn from experience rather than relying on explicit instructions.

I was provided with starter code that defined the environment, which included the state representation, reward structure, and a basic agent framework. This encompassed the game mechanics, visualization tools, and helper functions required to run training episodes. Additionally, I received a partially implemented reinforcement learning structure to help guide the overall design.

I took the initiative to write the core logic for the intelligent agent. This involved implementing the learning algorithm, defining how the agent selects actions (balancing exploration and exploitation), updating Q-values or neural network weights based on received rewards, and tuning hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration decay. I also modified and tested the training loop to ensure the agent learned effectively over time, with improved decision-making as training progressed.


# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

 Computer scientists design, analyze, and enhance computational systems to address complex problems. This is important because many real-world challenges—such as automation, decision-making, data analysis, and artificial intelligence—rely on efficient and reliable software solutions. This project demonstrates how computer science enables machines to learn from data and experience, a fundamental capability of modern AI applications, including robotics, recommendation systems, and game AI.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I tackle problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components and selecting appropriate algorithms and data structures. In this project, I focused on understanding the environment, defining the state and action spaces, choosing a reinforcement learning strategy, and iteratively testing and refining the model. I relied on experimentation, debugging, and performance evaluation to enhance the agent’s behavior, demonstrating the systematic, analytical mindset required in computer science.

# Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, I have an ethical responsibility to consider how my work impacts both end users and the organizations that deploy the technology. Intelligent agents and AI systems can significantly influence decisions, behaviors, and outcomes, so it is crucial to design them responsibly. This involves minimizing bias, ensuring transparency when possible, and avoiding harmful or unintended behaviors.

In the context of this project, ethical responsibility means creating learning systems that behave predictably, respect established constraints, and do not exploit weaknesses in the environment in unrealistic or unsafe ways. More broadly, it involves recognizing that AI systems should be designed to support and benefit people while aligning with organizational values, legal standards, and societal well-being.
